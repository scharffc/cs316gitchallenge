# CS316 Git Challenge

**Goal:** Practice git flow, pull request, merge and resolve conflict.

**Instructions**

1.	Together we're going to create to play a game to better understand how to collaborate using GitHub. There will be pull requests, merges and a bunch of conflicts.
2.	Go to the Git Challenge Repository.
3.	Play the game using these THREE RULES:
•	You will ONLY edit the file when on your own branch!
•	You will NEVER commit changes when on the main branch! You will commit on your own branch!
•	Do not delete the work of other students.

**Use the terminal to do the challenge**

4.	Clone the repo into a new directory
5.	Create a new branch, call it sign-in-yourName (this will be your feature branch) and check out this new branch using git checkout -b ***your feature branch name***
6.	Modify the sign-in.txt code to add your name and GitHub username below my name
7.	Commit the changes
8.	Push your feature branch to GitHub using git push origin ***your feature branch name***
Using GitHub
10.	Make a Pull Request from your branch to main to push changes
11.	Resolve the merge conflicts.
 * Be mindful not to delete other people's response.
 * You may have to deal with merge conflicts more than once through this process.
12.	Delete your branch when you're done.

**Stretch exercise**

Repeat the above exercise with your team in your own GitHub (team) account.
